                <h3>Life</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī</strong> was born into a Persian family 
                    in Khwarezm in Central Asia, today Khwarazm belongs partly to Uzbekistan and partly to Turkmenistan. <br>
                    Al-Khwārizmī was polymath who produced vastly influential works in mathematics, astronomy, and geography. <br>
                    Around 820 CE he was appointed as the astronomer and head of the library of the House of Wisdom in Baghdad. <br>
                    Al-Khwārizmī accomplished most of his work between 813 and 833. After the Muslim conquest of Persia, 
                    Baghdad had become the centre of scientific studies and trade, and many merchants and scientists from as far as China and India traveled there, 
                    as did al-Khwārizmī. <br>
                    He worked in the House of Wisdom established by the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma’mūn, where he studied the sciences 
                    and mathematics, including the translation of Greek and Sanskrit scientific manuscripts.

                <h3>Contributions</h3>
                <p>
                    Al-Khwārizmī's contributions to mathematics, geography, astronomy, and cartography established the basis for innovation in algebra and trigonometry. 
                    His systematic approach to solving linear and quadratic equations led to algebra, a word derived from the title of his book on the subject, 
                    "The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing".
                    On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals written about 820, was principally responsible for spreading the Hindu–Arabic numeral system 
                    throughout the Middle East and Europe.
                    Some of his work was based on Persian and Babylonian astronomy, Indian numbers, and Greek mathematics.
